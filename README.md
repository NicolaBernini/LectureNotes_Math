# LectureNotes_Math
Math related Lecture Notes 

## Description 

The goal of this project is to provide a set of **radically different** lecture notes regarding some math related topics. 

The main difference is the way every concept is presented: 

* first a brief description is provided 
* then the concept is presented in the math formalism 
* finally the same concept is presents by means of an *implementation* realized using a programming language, mainly C++ and Python 

The idea is to help students, especially those with a **coding backgroud** to better understand the concepts and to help the reader to think in an **implementative way** 

Presently I am working on a sort of *test topic* regarding [Introduction to Measure Theory](MeasureTheory/Intro1.ipynb) but I will soon switch to converting some of the lecture notes I have developed for my lessons, regarding **Deep Learning** to this format. 

Hopefully I will soon be able test this method in a lesson
